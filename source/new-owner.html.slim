      - Check that the top of the hood is not chipped from someone [lifting the wipers wrong](#do-not-lift-wipers).
      - Confirm that the dealer has [changed the telematics SIM status](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=2878#p2878) or the app might not work. Ideally, check that the app works before you leave.
      - Check that the locking wheel nut is included (it might be under the boot floor or in the glove compartment).
      - Check that both the type 1 "granny" charger (plugs into a wall socket) and the type 2 charging cable (7 pin connectors) are included.
      - If you didn't get a handover, [watch this 40 minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdOCamKuQVA).

        They may damage the hood. You should first put them into the maintenance position.

        Do so by powering off the car, then within 10 seconds hold the wiper switch in the MIST position for at least 2 seconds ([[manual 604]]). Once they've move into the maintenance position, you can lift them.

        When done, first put them back against the windscreen (or they will damage the hood as they return). Then turn power on and hold the wiper switch in the MIST position until both wiper arms return ([[manual 606]]).

    title: The car does not auto-lock when you walk away
    body: |
        You need to lock it by pressing the “lock” button on the key, or touching the ridged part at the top of the front door handles (using two fingers works best), or pressing the button inside the tailgate handle.

    title: Set your home address in the built-in satnav for scheduled charging to work
    body: |
        The car knows to apply the “home” charging schedule by checking the “home” location you’ve set in the built-in satnav. If you don’t set one, it won’t apply this schedule.

        For how to set it, see [the navigation manual, p. 18](https://www.honda.co.uk/cars/owners/manuals-and-guides/honda-owners-manuals/_jcr_content/par1/textcolumnwithimagem_2131108407/textColumn/richtextdownload_cc1/file.res/32TYF800_Navigation%20Book.pdf#page=18).

    anchor: charging-schedule
    title: "The \"Charging Wait Time Schedule\" sets the period when *not* to charge"
    body: |
        If you e.g. want your car to charge 00:30 to 04:30, the schedule should start at 04:30 and end at 00:30.

    title: Keep the locking wheel nut key in the car
    body: |
        The car likely came with “locking wheel nuts” – there will be one specially keyed nut on each wheel. It should also come with the unique key for these wheel nuts. Keep this key in the car as you’ll need it in case of a puncture. For a new car, the key may be in a box in the glove compartment together with the replaced regular wheel nuts.

        In [this test](https://autobest.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Key-Figures-and-indexes-of-ECOBEST-Challenge-2021.pdf?fbclid=IwAR10N3zlaabUWHAgepLKLrbe5Tm0I-7eWe8QV0VNWSsQjriWc-ecE0pSvEs) ([via this page](https://autobest.org/ecobest-challenge-electrified-by-vinfast-technical-backgrounds-and-key-figures-findings-and-interpretation/)), the Honda e Advance could go another 31.8 km (19.8 miles) after showing 0% state of charge. It’s likely bad for the battery to do this regularly, but could be good to know in an emergency situation.
