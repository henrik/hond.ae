    anchor: set-bg
    title: Set a custom background image
    body: |
        Make an image:

        - Ideally 3840 * 720 pixels. (Max 4096 * 2304.)
          - 578 pixels on either side will be covered by the "app launchers", with a transparency gradient, though you can [hide the passenger-side app launcher](#hide-passenger-launcher).
          - The wallpaper is split over two displays with a 60 pixel central black bar. ([Source](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=4899#p4899).) If you want the appearance of the wallpaper continuing behind the bar, make a 3900 * 720 pixel image and crop out the middle 60 pixels.
        - Less than 10 MB.
        - BMP (`.bmp`) or JPEG (`.jpg`).
        - File name max 64 bytes long.

        You can use a ready-made template to get the dimensions right:

        - Adobe Photoshop
          - [Template](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=5973#p5973) that doesn't account for the central bar.
          - [Template](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=12978#p12978) that crops out the central bar.
        - Pixelmator Pro
          - [Template and AppleScript](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=11087#p11087) that crop out the central bar.

        Put the image *at the root* of a USB drive.

        Connect the drive to the data-enabled front USB port (not the one with a battery icon).

        Go to General Settings > Display > Wallpaper to import or switch wallpaper.

        ([[manual 272–273]].)

        See [this forum thread](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=255) for inspiration and ready-made images.

    anchor: aquarium
    title: (Re)install the Aquarium app
    body: |
      The aquarium app is not pre-installed on a new car and needs to be reinstalled if the infotainment system is reset.

      Once installed, you'll find it in "All Apps" and then "Aquarium".

      It used to be possible to download it via "Honda App Center", but that is no longer the case. ([Source](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=13982#p13982).)

      You can download the app file and (German) instructions via [this forum post](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=14241#p14241). Installation is via a USB stick.

      Or ask your dealer to install it. ([Source](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=13982#p13982).)

    anchor: turn-off-climate-feedback
    title: Turn off the feedback display for climate controls
    body: |
        When you use climate controls, the screen will show an overlay for a few seconds, which can get in the way of e.g. satnav.

        To turn it off:

        1. Put the car into "ready to drive" mode.
        2. On the climate control system:
             - Turn the temperature down to "Lo".
             - Press "MODE" until it shows ![Air flows from floor and dashboard vents](/images/icon-vents.png).
             - Turn on ![](/images/icon-recirculation.png) recirculation.
             - Press "ON/OFF" to turn off the climate control system.
        3. Turn the car off.
        4. On the climate control system, press and hold both "MODE" and ![](/images/icon-recirculation.png) recirculation.
        5. While keeping the buttons pressed, put the car into "ready to drive" mode.
        6. The AC display should show "31.0". Keep the buttons pressed until it shows "19.0", then release them.

        To switch the feedback display back on, repeat the steps above, except:

        - In step 2, turn the temperature up to "Hi".
        - In step 6, wait for the display to show "31.0", then release the buttons.

    anchor: auto-reset-trip-meter
    title: Automatically reset the trip meter
    body: |
        The "Range & Energy" screen on the dashboard ([[manual 158–159]]) shows distance travelled and average energy consumption. The scroll wheel will switch between two trips called "A" and "B".

        The "Speed & Time" screen ([[manual 160–161]]) shows elapsed time and average speed for trip A or B.

        You can configure one of these trips to automatically reset every time you turn off the car. If you automatically reset say B but not A, you can see both your lifetime stats and those for your current trip.

        Open the car's "Vehicle Settings" app, then choose "Meter setup". Change e.g. "Trip B reset timing" to "POWER OFF". ([[manual 339]].)

    anchor: directions-on-dashboard
    title: See turn-by-turn directions on the instrument panel
    body: |
        You need to use a supported app to see turn-by-turn directions on the display in front of the driver.

        Either use the built-in navigation, or Apple Maps via CarPlay, or Google Maps via Android Auto.

        Directions will show just in time as they become relevant. To show them permanently, switch to "Navigation" using the left selector wheel on the steering wheel.

    title: Play/pause music via physical buttons
    body: |
        The “⏻ AUDIO” button on the dashboard will effectively play/pause music. On wireless CarPlay, you will lose a few seconds when you un-pause.

        To play/pause CarPlay from the steering wheel, you can select “Audio” and then scroll the wheel to some other input like Bluetooth and select it to pause. Scroll back to CarPlay to resume.

    title: Skip songs from the passenger seat
    body: |
        Open the car's audio information screen, e.g. by tapping the current song name at the top of the screen while playing audio.

        Use the Screen Switch icon to put it on the passenger screen if it's not already there.

        Now the passenger can skip songs from this screen while the driver uses their screen for e.g. navigation.

    anchor: hdmi-while-driving
    title: Enable HDMI while driving
    body: |
        Normally you can’t play HDMI video while driving, but this can be enabled via a secret diagnostics menu – though it resets when the car is restarted.

        Don’t watch video while driving! Only use this for the benefit of passengers.

        [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB_NJ2xRQag) shows how to do it. Also see [the forum discussion](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=365).

        Also see the video comments mentioning a further step that might help with some devices.

        The video comments suggest that the instructions don't work for all Android devices.

    anchor: avoid-flat-12v
    title: Avoid the 12V battery running flat
    body: |
        Keep the driver’s seat belt fastened if you leave the car on when stopped.

        If the seat belt is not fastened, after a while the car will show this dialog: "The vehicle automatically turns OFF to save battery power after a while. Do you want to cancel this function? Yes / No".

        Presumably this is about preserving the 12V battery which powers e.g. the infotainment system and the 12V socket used for the air compressor in the included tyre repair kit. There are [horror stories](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?t=656) about it going flat.

        Fastening the driver’s seat belt makes the dialog go away. The assumption is that with the seat belt fastened, the car will charge the 12V battery.

        You can even use a [loose seat belt clip](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B09HXLRDC2) for convenience.

        [This first aid kid](https://hondadirectparts.co.uk/parts/honda-jazz-genuine-parts/honda-jazz-2020-currect-first-aid-kit/) and [this warning triangle](https://hondadirectparts.co.uk/parts/honda-e/accessories-honda-e/honda-warning-triangle/) (UK store) fit perfectly in the empty slots.

        Or you can put the box of wheel nuts where the first aid kit would go (as in image above).

        Or the wheel nut key on its own can fit next to the warning triangle (as in image below).

    anchor: finish-driving
    title: Finish driving
    body: |
        This seems to be the fewest steps:

        1. Press the “POWER” button. This will automatically put the car in Park and *may* (see below) automatically apply the parking brake.
        2. Leave the car.
        3. Lock the car.

        Turning the car off appears to automatically apply the parking brake *if* “auto brake” or “single pedal control” were on – watch for the parking brake button’s indicator light to come on. If not, engage it manually. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/2980600845528718/).)

        You can turn on “automatic parking brake” ([[manual 501–502]]) in which case it should always engage when the car is turned off. Mind the manual’s warnings: the brake can freeze in cold weather and should not be engaged for conveyor-type car washes or towing.

    anchor: maximise-range
    title: Maximise range
    body: |
      If it's cold outside, precondition the car while plugged in. This preheats the battery, giving higher efficiency. It's unclear whether this only happens at the "warmer" setting. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/3283578168564316/).)

      Using the AC for heating or cooling uses a lot of energy. If you want to maximise range at the expense of comfort, turn it off, or use the heated seats and steering wheel. They require much less energy. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/2975441012711368/).)

      The 16" wheels give [slightly better range](/prospective-owner/#wheels) than 17".

    anchor: park-a-while
    title: Leave your car parked for a while
    body: |
      Leaving your car at the airport? Thankfully, charging losses when parked seem small.

      There have been reports of losing 0% when parked for a week, and 3% when parked for a 4 weeks. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/3234230593499074/). [Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/3099402523648549/).)

      Make sure to deactivate any preconditioning schedule since that will use up some charge.
