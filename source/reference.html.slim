      Measurements are approximate and may depend on seat positions.

      The max payload (including driver and passengers) is **341–342 kg** for the base model and **327–350 kg** for the Advance model. ([Source](https://www.rowes.co.uk/honda/pdf/honda-e.pdf), p. 48.)

      - 16" wheels: 240 kPa / 2.4 bar / 35 psi ([source](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=6291#p6291))
      - 17" wheels: 230 kPa / 2.3 bar / 33 psi (source: photo above)

      The pressure is the same front and back since the car has a 50/50 weight distribution.

      Recalibrate the tyre pressure warning system after changing the tyre pressure. Open the car's "Vehicle Settings" app, select "Deflation Warning System", then "Calibrate". Then drive for approximately 30 minutes ([[manual 421–422]]).
