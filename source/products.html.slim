        Notes on some popular HDMI devices:

        - Google Chromecast: Can't stream from an iPhone while also using that iPhone as a hotspot. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/2981960938726042/).)
        - Roku: HD is enough; 4K is wasted on the car's 720p display. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/2981960938726042/?comment_id=2982281448693991).)
        - Amazon Firestick: HD is enough; 4K is wasted on the car's 720p display. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/2981960938726042/?comment_id=2985517711703698).)
        - [Apple Lightning Digital AV Adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MD826AM/A/lightning-digital-av-adapter) with iPhone: The phone needs to be tethered and can't be used for other things at the same time. Phone screen can't be turned off. Had letterboxing where Firestick didn't, and worse audio. CarPlay needs to be turned off while using. ([Source](https://www.facebook.com/groups/HondaeUK/posts/2981960938726042/?comment_id=2985517711703698&reply_comment_id=2985529781702491). [Source](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=8550#p8550).)
        - Nintendo Switch: Works. ([Source](https://www.hondaeforums.com/viewtopic.php?p=4534#p4534).)

    title: Home chargers
    body: |
        The car should be compatible with all [type 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_2_connector) home chargers.

        It charges at up to 6.6 kW from home chargers ([source](https://ev-database.uk/car/1233/Honda-e-Advance#charging)), meaning a 7 kW charger is enough â€“ a 22 kW charger will also work, but won't charge the car any faster.

        If you schedule charging times, consider whether to do so in the car or in the charger. If you do it in the car, it will be able to draw power for any preconditioning outside of the schedule, leaving you with more charge. If you do it in the charger, the car will not be able to draw power outside of that schedule. Also note that [the charging schedule is confusing](/new-owner#charging-schedule).
